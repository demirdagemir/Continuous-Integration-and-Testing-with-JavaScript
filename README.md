# Continuous-Integration-and-Testing-with-JavaScript
This repo is used for "Continuous Integration and Testing with JavaScript" workshop presentation for [JS Rost Lab](https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/Javascript_technology_2017).

## Topics Covered

- This topic is all about the software development cycle with JavaScript. Starting with behaviour driven development and unit testing (e.g. with Mocha), we then take a look at larger-scale integration testing and especially continuous integration strategies (e.g. with Travis). To finish the testing cycle, we take a look at system and deployment testing (e.g. with Docker).
